# Insurance-Dataset-Visualization-and-Statistical-Analysis
In this project, I performed an in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on an insurance dataset, calculated various statistical measures, removed outliers, and explored the relationships between different variables using statistical tests.
Through this project, I gained valuable experience in:
Conducting comprehensive EDA on a real-world dataset
Applying statistical techniques to understand the data and identify meaningful insights
Effectively communicating the findings through clear and visually appealing visualizations
